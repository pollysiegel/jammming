Jammming -- codecademy project class

Class project for codecademy building FE apps.  The app is deployed at http://coda.surge.sh

# Notes on the project:
* There is a problem with authentication.  You need to first do something (search or save playlist) to get the authorization 
redirect URL to load.  Once it loads, everything will work.
* I've added some code to display when there are no search results
* Bugs that need to be fixed include:
 * when you type something in, it should erase what's currently in the search box (for both search and save playlist

 
# Enhancements to do:
* would like to retrieve existing playlists


# Notes for the course organizers
* This project (and this class) was extremely frustrating. The instructions were unclear, and the material leading up
to doing this class were not structured in such a way as to allow you to do this project easily. I'd recommend that at the
end of every "assessment" in the project, you have a description of the results that learners should be seeing. Some of
the project steps are not constructed in a way that this is possible, so I'd recommend redoing the project so that it is.
I have more suggestions I'd be happy to discuss, so just contact me if you want to do so.
* Given the difficulty, I think you should slate two weeks for this project.
* The advisors were fantastic!
